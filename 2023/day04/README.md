# Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers.

## What is Kernel

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell

A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

**Tasks**

- Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
  Shell scripting is the process of writing various scripts, which are made by combining one or more shell commands, to perform some important and repeatable tasks. Various programming constructs such as if..else, for loop and while loop can be used in the scripts to write complex logics. For example, a shell script can consist of a set of commands to take some strings as user input and append them into a file.
  
- What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
  '#!/bin/bash' is known as a Shabang. It is a derictive for the program loader, which shell program should be used to run this script. This shabang directs the system to use Bash interpretor to run the script. But if we use another shabang such as '#!/bin/sh', it will direct the system to us the default shell program to execute the script. This default shell could be either Bash,Dash or any other shell interpretor.
   
- Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`

- Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
