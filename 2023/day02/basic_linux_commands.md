### Directoy commands
- ```pwd``` --> print work directory. Gives the present working directory.

- ```cd path_to_directory``` --> change directory to the provided path

- ```cd ~ ``` or just  ```cd ``` --> change directory to the home directory

- ``` cd - ``` --> Go to the last working directory.

- ``` cd ..``` --> change directory to one step back.

- ``` cd ../..``` --> Change directory to 2 levels back.

- ``` mkdir  directoryName``` --> to make a directory in a specific location

Examples:
```
mkdir newFolder              # make a new folder 'newFolder'

mkdir .NewFolder              # make a hidden directory (also . before a file to make it hidden)

mkdir A B C D                  #make multiple directories at the same time

mkdir /home/user/Mydirectory   # make a new folder in a specific location

mkdir -p  A/B/C/D              # make a nested directory
```
